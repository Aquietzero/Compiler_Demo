                <p>Compiler demo shows most of the compiling algorithms in the dragon book. In the input page, you are required to enter a set of terminals and a grammar. You have to obey some rule when entering these information and the instruction of input will be shown right above the input area. Please pay attention to that. Since this is just a demo of the algorithms in the book, so I am not going to pay too much energy on the design of error input detection. If you want to have a nice trip, please do not try to enter some strange grammar to break down the program. You valid behavior is expected and respected.</p>

                <h2>❉ Welcome</h2>
                <p>Compilers plays amazing magic, but the course of compiler theorem disappoints the crowd. Maybe you still have some passion to know something about this fantastic area or you won't be in this site. Aiming at telling the story behind the complicated algorithms visually, I spent most of my time on creating this site, which I should have spent on homework. Please step around, grab something you need and your suggestion will be appreciated.</p>
                <p>Frankly, I have to say that compiler is the most abstract course that I have ever encountered. Absorbing the book is not an easy task. It already takes a lot of time to scan it. With most of the assignments in java, I think it still hard to understand the machanism behind the algorithms in the book. So I have a strong desire to present the algorithms in the book in another way, in a more vivid and intuitive way. The construction of the site is undoubtly the most exciting project that drives me moving forward in these two months. Now I present the site for you, hope you who step in this demo have a wonderful time.</p>
