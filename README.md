#Complier Demo#
---------------

##Description##
Compliers Theorem is one of my most important courses this term. However, the teaching style of the teacher and the java-based homework disgust me. As a result, I come up with an idea that I can both learn something from the book myself and I can have some programming task. So I plan to implement most of the compiling algorithms in the **Dragon Book** in javascript and wrap it with a visual web demostration.

##Plan##
1. Main structures: Lexical Analysis, Syntax Analysis, Semantic Analysis.
2. Implement the algorithms in these three main procedures of the whole compiling process.
3. Separation of the implementation of the algorithms and the visual demostrations.

##Finished##
1. First set algorithm.
2. Follow set algorithm.
3. Construction of the predictive analysis table.
4. Table-driven predictive analysis algorithm.
